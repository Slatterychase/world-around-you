00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
I rode through smoke in the woods,

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
closer to the battlefield where battle had just finished.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
There were actually people lying on the field hurt,

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
with blood on their clothes and gauzes wrapped around their heads.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
People were gathered, helping.
