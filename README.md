# World Around You

World Around You is a digital library of stories, created collaboratively by Deaf and hearing people for Deaf children and their families, the school community, and the Deaf community. It is a web platform designed to make collaboration easy for uploading and editing contents for reading and viewing. It provides a space to watch, read, interact, like, share, comment, upload, and edit the contents. 

This is the demo of the reader's view. Each dot along the slider bar represents a page. Each page has 3 components, or sub-pages: photo, signed video, and glossary interactivity. 

## Key features

- After hovering over menu buttons for 0.5 seconds, a text description appears. Users often will stay that long on a button if they are uncertain what it does.

- Pagine through full story either using arrows or slider bar.
- Take entire panel fullscreen for an immersive user experience.

- Change written language at any point.
- On 1st page (after title page)
    - Change sign language. Limitation: Make sure you change back to FSL: Luzon before going to any other page. 
    - Click on glossary terms to view interactivity (video loop & photo corresponding to term). Click anywhere else on the screen to stop the video loop & return to original view. 
- Drag to slide video thumbnail carousels, and hover over thumbnails for interactivity.

## Demo limitations

- GitHub serves large files with a lag. In this demo, videos are large files. For optimal performance, download and run locally. 

## Bugs to fix
- Closing fullscreen on the third component, because the text will not resize properly. 
- Leaving text in the search bar, because it will overlap with the search icon.
- Non-responsive web components.
